# COVID-19-Confirmed-Cases-Prediction-in-India-using-Machine-learning-and-Deep-Learning
In this project 3 machine learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Random
Forest, Polynomial regression, and a LSTM Deep Learning Neural Net
algorithm were used. These algorithms were implemented on the COVID19 confirmed cases dataset generated by the John Hopkins Centre for
System Science and Engineering to determine which algorithm gives the
most optimal predicitions of the prospective cases.

Note: Link for the dataset is used in the code.
